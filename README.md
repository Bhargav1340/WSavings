# WSavings
Problem given in inspirathon 2.0 
I have tried to create solution of following problem: "Being financially literate is a powerful weapon, especially for women"
I have created front end web application to track savings & expenses. It basically shows all savings, and based on your expenses it also shows expected savings.
To create this frontend Html & CSS are used.
It can be run on any machine. (recommended: screen size: about 1024px).
Created from scratch by own.
